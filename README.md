# Analog2USBPhone

Convert an old Analog Phone to an USB-Headset for ZOOM© and TEAMS©
Based on a Teensy 4.0 and the Audio-Board Rev.D

Functions:
The Phone will behave like in the old days.
It plays the line tone 440Hz when you pick up the Headset
It rings the bell while the Headset is not picked up and audio comes in from USB
It sends the dedicated Number as Keystrokes by using the dialer
It pickup and hang up the call, by sending keyboard shortcuts while you in the application
It mutes the microphone when the headset is picked up and the dailer is just move a bit

Ringer Coil
To get the Coil moving it needs more than 5V, because the coil has high ohms.
A DC/DC Converter which outputs min. 24V has to be used.
To controll the coil back and forth, you have to use a Driver like the L239B

Have fun by building one for you.
It's even more fun to use it and show it off to your colleagues at the office :-)
